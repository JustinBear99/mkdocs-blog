# Google Cloud Study Jam 2023

## Introduction

This is an event provided by Google to let developers learn cloud related skills from their Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for **free**. Also, the participants are rewarded with gifts based on their progress within the learning period. I've earned a small bag and a wireless charger last year XD and they provide even better gift this year, a mug!

## Not so Easy

From my experience last year, some labs (tasks to prove you actually learn) required enormous background knowledge on networking, virtualization and others to finish and I spent lots of time to either google or try-and-error it. Hence, I would like to share my soultion (not all labs but the one I think needed) here to help you finish this event.
